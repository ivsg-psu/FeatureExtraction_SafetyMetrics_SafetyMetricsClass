function [station, acceleration_x, acceleration_y] = fcn_AVConsistency_acceleVector_filtered_position(vehData,filterFlag,varargin)
% fcn_AVConsistency_acceleVector_filtered_position.m
% This function computes the total acceleration vector of a vehicle, measured at its center of gravity. 
% The vector's magnitude and direction provide insights into cornering, braking, and tractive forces. 
% Understanding these forces is crucial in determining the friction utilization of the AV at different 
% locations, particularly in work zones. This information helps ascertain the remaining maneuvering 
% capacity of the AVâ€”how it may respond to sudden obstacles without skidding, for instance.
%
% FORMAT:
%
%       [station, acceleration_x, acceleration_y] = 
%       fcn_AVConsistency_acceleVector_filtered_position(vehData, filterFlag)
%
% INPUTS:
%       vehData: Vehicle data, usually in table format, containing columns like vehicle_x, vehicle_y, and timestep_time.
%       filterFlag: A flag to decide whether to use filtered (1) or unfiltered (0) positions.
%
% (optional)
%       varargin: figure number
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       station: The station (or snapStation) of the vehicle.
%       acceleration_x: The acceleration of the vehicle in the x-direction.
%       acceleration_y: The acceleration of the vehicle in the y-direction.
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%      NA.
